# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-with-TensorFlow-Keras
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy through data preparation, augmentation, and a well-structured neural network architecture.
